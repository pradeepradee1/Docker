How to run docker file ?
	docker build -t getting-started:latest .

Docker image is created

we can check it in the 
	docker image ls

Now We have to run the docker iamge
	docker run -p 3000:3000 a677e4fd959b

We can check in the website (localhost:3000)

If we run docker file again or execute docker build -t getting-started:latest .
	we will have latest image


As like GitHub we can also push it to the DockerHub

Intitall we need to configurations
	docker tag {directory_name} pradeepkumarasamy/{directory_name}

then check it in docker image ls

docker push pradeepkumarasamy/app

Once Image is pushed in DockerHub and we can run it in the DockerHub
